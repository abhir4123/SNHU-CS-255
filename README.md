# SNHU-CS-255

The DriverPass project was for a company that wanted to improve the way students prepare for their driving tests. The client, DriverPass, needed a system that would allow students to register, take online driving courses, schedule on-road lessons, and track their progress. The system also needed to support administrative functions like managing users, packages, and system activity to ensure smooth operations. One thing I did well was organizing the system’s requirements and structuring them clearly in the business requirements document. I made sure to cover both functional and nonfunctional requirements in a way that addressed DriverPass’s needs while keeping it easy to understand. I also created UML diagrams, such as use case and activity diagrams, that effectively illustrated system interactions and workflows. If I could revise one part, it would be the system limitations section. I would go into more detail about potential solutions to these limitations, such as how additional languages could be integrated in future updates or how system performance could be optimized as user demand increases. Providing more insight into possible improvements would make the document more useful for the future.
      
I interpreted the user’s needs by analyzing the interview transcript and identifying important functions that students, administrators, and instructors required. I made sure that the system design reflected these needs by including features like appointment scheduling, online classes, and progress tracking. Considering the user’s needs is very important because a system that doesn’t align with what users expect will lead to frustration and low adoption. A well-designed system makes tasks easier and improves the overall experience. My approach to software design starts with gathering clear requirements from stakeholders and understanding how users will interact with the system. I use process and object modeling techniques, such as use case diagrams, sequence diagrams, and class diagrams, to visualize system functionality and structure. In the future, I would incorporate more user feedback early in the design process to ensure that the system meets real-world needs. I would also focus more on scalability and future expansion, making sure the system can grow as business needs change.
